This program predicts which of the 16 plants the given image is.

In the first part, the program compares the neural networks that I have implemented with different learning rates (0.005, 0.01, and 0.02), 
different activation functions (sigmoid, relu, and tanH) , different batches(16, 32, and 64),
and different hidden layers (no hidden layer, one hidden layer, and 2 hidden layers).

In the second part, the program predicts the images by using PyTorch.
